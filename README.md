# Three-sided-coin
Here's the code I used for my physics project.

The code to the simulation was adapted from sirrandalot's version (https://github.com/sirrandalot/three-sided-coin), yet strongly altered. The file browser used for making saving data more convenient was taken from yasirkula (https://github.com/yasirkula/UnitySimpleFileBrowser).
See the releases to download an executable file.
I apologize for the ugly code, it was my first time working with Unity as well as C#.

The python script I wrote myself to compute the model I derived in my project.
